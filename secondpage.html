    <h1>Cosmetic mods for your chevy</h1>
    <h2>Extirior mods</h2>
    Some exterior mods you can add to your truck are rock lights you can put them on your rims under the truck and add a lot of light this is a good mod for your truck if you plan on going offroading it can provide more light if you go off-roading at night which is really important and helpful.You could change a lot with your truck if you wanted to if you go with the offroad build you could get a different bumper with a different material so it could take some pretty big hits or add a skid plate. Or if you build a drag racing truck you could add a spoiler or different types of rims/wheels.

<h3>Interior mods</h3>
Some interior mods you could do is change the carpets and get a nice one or get a touchscreen radio you could get starlights for the roof if you have an older model of a truck you could upgrade by making it more modern adding electric windows or adding a better stereo system upgrading the seats or just customizing the interior to your liking.You could also add bucket seats if you were making a race truck adding better seatbelts and fixing up the emergency brake. This is kind of both an interior and exterior mod but you could tint your windows which affects the interior and exterior.
