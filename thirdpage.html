<h1>What type of truck builds can you make</h1>
the two main different types of builds when it comes to trucks are lowered vs lifted trucks

<h2>lifted trucks</h2>
    What are lifted trucks? Lifted trucks are what they are lifted trucks you can turn any truck into a lifted truck with a lift kit and if you wanted to you could make your truck wider too these are more for offroading this is the style of truck builds that I prefer although I do like lowered trucks  

<h3>Lowered trucks</h3>
    Lowered trucks are just trucks that are lowered with a drop kit you can do this for drag racing or just for preference although this mod basically turns your truck into a sports car. The thing with lowered trucks is that if you lower your truck it loses a lot of the uses that a truck is used for for example it cant carry as much anymore and it just doesn't work as much as a truck anymore
