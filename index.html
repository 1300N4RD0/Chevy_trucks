      <h2>Supercharger</h2>
      <p> A supercharger can be good if you just want some extra raw power if you want more horses to your engine it can also give your engine a different sound. With the turbocharger what it does is get more air but with a turbocharger what it does is different. Instead of getting more, it puts more pressure on the air to make the internal combustion stronger giving it more raw power and making it stronger  </p>

      <h3>Turbocharger</h3>
      <p> Turbochargers are also good for power but they are better for fuel economy which is good because it helps you save money if you are planning on making a lot of expensive mods to your trucks. What does a turbo charger do? So the way an engine works is it needs air to run it and what the turbo does is it gets more air and sends it directly to the engine and giving it more power</p>
